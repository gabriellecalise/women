Week 1

This week I planned a lot of my project. I decided that I want to design the website for college-aged students (especially females), so I found more specific data sets and facts that pertain to people ages 18 through their mid 20s. I found images from the Creative Commons search. I made a few charts in Highcharts and designed the website layout. I'm still using the same Wrap Bootstrap theme, but I want my page to have  the colors and minimal design like this site http://www.monochrome.paris/.

Instead of just having people scroll through the page, I will have interactive questions that will motivate the user to keep clicking (and therefore learning). For the purpose of organization, I have included links to each of the sources where I found the fact. When I actually create the site, the links will be embedded in a smoother way. The facts that I present will be tailored to each user based on how they answer the questions or interact with the site.

This is how I want the page to look. Each new space is a 100% width panel that the viewer sees, and then they scroll down to see the next panel


"Women have come so far in America" (Picture of suffragist parade)

"From gaining the right to vote" (black and white voting picture)

"To getting more control over our bodies and careers" (pic of successful career woman - I haven't picked one yet)

"We've gone more places, from higher office" (pic of Supreme Court Justices)

"To beyond" (Sally Ride in Space)

"But there is still so much left to do" (pic of protest)
Button: "So let's get started" (solid color screen)

"How do you want to change the world?"
3 choices:
  1. Let's talk money
  2. Stop violence against women
  3. What's up with reproductive rights?


Category 1: Let's Talk Money

Quick quiz:
The wage gap is a myth -- true or false?
  If you click true -- The bad news: According to the US Department of Commerce, the average woman made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned in 2014. The good news: the gap is smaller for young women, who earn 93% of the average hourly wage of men the same age (according to the Pew Research Center).

  If you click false -- Unfortunately, According to the US Department of Commerce, the average woman made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned in 2014. The good news: the gap is smaller for young women, who earn 93% of the average hourly wage of men the same age (according to the Pew Research Center).

What do you think happens as women age?
  Button: It gets better
    "It actually gets worse.
      Even if ladies make the same amount as their male counterparts early in their careers, there's something called the motherhood penalty that can trip them up later in life.
      University of Massachusetts sociologist Michelle Budig found that on average, men make 6% more when they had children, and women made 4% less for EACH child that they had.
      (http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay)""

  Button:  It gets worse
    "Yup. Even if ladies make the same amount as their male counterparts early in their careers, there's something called the motherhood penalty that can trip them up later in life.
    University of Massachusetts sociologist Michelle Budig found that on average, men make 6% more when they had children, and women made 4% less for EACH child that they had. (http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay)

    The gap is also worse for women of color http://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/"


    Why is this happening?
    - Women are not socially conditioned to negotiate.
    - Differences in experience, industry or education.
    - Factors that are difficult to measure such as discrimination.
      http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/
        The Pew Research Center has determined that there IS a wage gap.
        -	Occupational segregation differences in the number of hours worked, and educational attainment are commonly cited as factors that created the gap.
        -	But there are reasons that experts say are contribute to 20-40% of the wage gap: discrimination, gender stereotypes, male-dominated career networks and the fact that women are less likely to negotiate for raises and promotions. These are much harder to quantify. http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/
        -	some part of the pay gap may also be due to gender discrimination – women are about twice as likely as men to say they had been discriminated against at work because of their gender (18% vs. 10%). http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/





True or false – the United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t have paid maternity or family leave.
  True. There is no guaranteed family leave, unless your employer grants it or you live in California, Rhode Island or New Jersey, which offer state-mandated paid leave.
  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 13 percent of employers offer paid maternity leave
  (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/)
  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/26/u-s-lacks-mandated-paid-parental-leave/

  This is a problem because women caregiving typically falls on women. However, 40 percent of women are breadwinners for their families, and 70 percent of mothers work outside the home.

  It is estimated that the Gender Gap will take 118 years to close worldwide http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/gender-pay-gap-will-be-erased-it-will-take-118-n466631 So what can you do to help?

  2. Violence Against Women

1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted during their college years, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

New slide: More often than not, the offender is someone that the  survivor knew (insert pie chart that I made https://jsfiddle.net/gabriellecalise/v4s33p6t/)

-	Statistics from "Rape and violence against college aged females" – I’m using this document because it specifically focuses on college-aged women and that’s definitely the age group that I’m targeting with this project

New slide: Domestic Violence By the Numbers
- In the United States, a woman is beaten or assaulted every 9 seconds
- One-third of female homicide victims are women killed by an intimate partner.
- There are more than 10 million domestic violence survivors each year.
- On a typical day, domestic violence hotlines nationwide receive approximately 20,800  calls
 -- According to a fact sheet by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in the United States.
https://ncadv.org/files/National%20Statistics%20Domestic%20Violence%20NCADV.pdf
- Domestic violence is most prevalent from ages 18-24. http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf


New slide: So what exactly counts as domestic violence?
  -(for this section, I want to create a row of photos (similar to the album artwork assignment) that each represent a different type of abuse. When each picture is clicked, a list of abusive behaviors in that category drops down.)
Different categories:   
  -Physical abuse
  -Emotional abuse
  -Sexual abuse and coercion
  -Reproductive coercion
  -Financial abuse
  -Digital abuse
http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/#tab-id-5
Underneath photos be two buttons:
-"Assess your relationship"
-"I'm not seeing anyone right now, but I want to learn more"

The "Assess your relationship" button links to this page:
"You might be in an abusive relationship and not even know it. Do any of these things sound like something your partner would do? (Checklist copied from the National Domestic Violence Hotline http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/#tab-id-5 )
"
(Checkbox options:)
 - Telling you that you can never do anything right
 - Showing jealousy of your friends and time spent away
 - Keeping you or discouraging you from seeing friends or family members
 - Insulting, demeaning or shaming you with put-downs
 - Controlling every penny spent in the household
 - Taking your money or refusing to give you money for expenses
 - Looking at you or acting in ways that scare you
 - Controlling who you see, where you go, or what you do
 - Preventing you from making your own decisions
 - Telling you that you are a bad parent or threatening to harm or take away your children
 - Preventing you from working or attending school
 - Destroying your property or threatening to hurt or kill your pets
 - Intimidating you with guns, knives or other weapons
 - Pressuring you to have sex when you don’t want to or do things sexually you’re not comfortable with
 - Pressuring you to use drugs or alcohol
 If the user clicks any of the options, a red box will pop up that says
   "Each relationship is different, so it might be hard to tell if something is wrong or abusive. If you feel like you might be experiencing abusive behaviors, know that you are not alone. You can get help by calling 1-866-331-9474 or texting "loveis" to 22522"

3. Reproductive Rights

According to a 10-year survey by the Pew Research Center (http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/domestic-issues/abortion/),
56% percent of Americans think that abortion  should be legal in all or most cases.
What do you think?
  Yes Button
  No Button

If you said Yes
  You're right, and it's up to you to make sure that women can still access abortions.

  Why?
  The rate of abortions is similar in countries where abortion is legal and illegal – meaning that if safe abortions aren’t available, women will get them anyway. (According to a global study by the World Health Organization http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html)
    About 20 million abortions that would be considered unsafe were performed anyway.
    67,000 women die as a result of complications from this procedure.

What else do family planning services like Planned Parenthood do?
  -	Pie chart – all of the services that planned parenthood does (FOUND IN THE Planned Parenthood annual REPORT)
   Birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing and treatment. https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/7-things-you-can-do-help-planned-parenthood-and-the-communities-it-serves/#sthash.f3JmJdOz.dpuf https://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/2014-2015_annual_report_final_20mb 	https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance

    Get involved
    - Become a clinic escort. Protesters often gather outside of abortion clinics to chant and scream at women who are going inside. NY Magazine posted a guide here http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/11/how-to-become-an-abortion-clinic-escort.html

    -	Volunteer with Planned Parenthood to bring education and health services to women. Find opportunities in your state here https://plannedparenthoodrccorpvolunteer.peoplefluent.com/joblist.html?erpc=alljobs

    - College students can join Planned Parenthood Generation Action. This program raises awareness about reproductive rights and sexual health. To see what your campus offers, go here https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/community/planned-parenthood-generation-action/find-your-planned-parenthood-generation-action-group. To start your own chapter, contact Planned Parenthood here https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/community/planned-parenthood-generation-action/contact-planned-parenthood-generation-action/.

Send an email to Congress asking them to lift government restrictions on abortion access. You can find your elected official here!  http://action.allaboveall.org/page/speakout/lift-the-bans

    -	Contact your representative on these issues  http://now.org/issues/abortion-rights-reproductive-issues/

    - Button that says "What else can we do?" that goes to the sex education reform page



If you said NO
  43% of Americans share your beliefs.

  The bad news is the rate of abortions is similar in countries where abortion is legal and illegal – meaning that if safe abortions aren’t available, women will get them anyway. (According to a global study by the World Health Organization http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html)
    About 20 million abortions that would be considered unsafe were performed anyway.
    67,000 women die as a result of complications from this procedure.

  The good news: There's a way to reduce the number of abortions without making it illegal and forcing women to get risky clandestine procedures.

  Publicly-funded family planning services are crucial  in providing resources for women -- both the ladies that want families and those who don't.
    According to the Guttmacher Institute, these facilities helped women avoid two million unintended pregnancies. The Institute estimates that those pregnancies would have resulted in 900,000 unplanned births and nearly 700,000 abortions.

    Title X is the US Government's program that funds confidential, low-cost family planning services
      - According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, funding for the U.S. Government's Title X is decreasing. It's 61% lower today than it was in 1980.
    https://www.reproductiverights.org/project/contraceptive-access-in-the-united-states
      - To help, you can support family planning services. Donate to them, and don't shame the people that use them.
      - Pester your elected officials and let them know that this is not ok!


What else can we do?
  - You can support comprehensive, fact-based sex education!
    More than 47 percent of high school students say they've had sex, according to a 2011 study by the CDC.  (http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-policies-on-sex-education-in-schools.aspx). And only 60% of the students surveyed said they used a condom during their last sexual encounter!

    Here's the insane part -- only 22 states mandate sex education. But only 13 require that sex ed is medically  accurate.https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-policies-on-sex-education-in-schools.aspx

    Studies show that abstinence-only education is not effective, according to the United Nations Population Fund. (link to http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education# http://thenationalcampaign.org/sites/default/files/resource-primary-download/EA2007_full_0.pdf)

  - We need to make sexual and reproductive health more accessible to adolescents. http://www.unfpa.org/resources/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health



  Several states have enacted refusal clauses that let healthcare providers and pharmacists refuse to give patients medication.
