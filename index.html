    <p> Even if ladies make the same amount as their male counterparts early in their careers, there's something called the <strong>motherhood penalty</strong> that can make things harder for them later in life. </p>

    <p>University of Massachusetts sociologist Michelle Budig found that on average, <a href= "http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay"> men make 6% more when they had children, and women made 4% less for EACH child that they had.</a>

        <h2> Answer: True</h2>
            <p> There is no guaranteed family leave, unless your employer grants it or you live in California, Rhode Island or New Jersey, which offer state-mandated paid leave. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/"> only 13 percent of employers offer paid maternity leave</a>. </p>

            <p>This is a problem because caregiving typically falls on women. However, <a href="  http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/no-paid-maternity-leave/470889/">40 percent of women are breadwinners for their families, and 70 percent of mothers work outside the home.</a> </p>

    <h1> Ok, so why is the wage gap happening? </h1>
    <ul>
     <li>Some common reasons for the wage gap are occupational segregation, differences in the number of hours worked and educational attainment.</li>

     <li> Finally, some of the gap can be explained by gender descrimination. Women are <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/"> twice as likely </a> to say that they felt descriminated in the workplace. </li>

<h1>Stopping Violence Against Women</h1>
<h2>The facts, the stats, and how you can help</h2>

<h3>1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted during their college years, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.</h3>

<h4> In about <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf"> 80% of rape and sexual assault cases for people ages 18-24</a> the offender was someone that the victim knew.</h4>

<p> (insert pie chart that I made https://jsfiddle.net/gabriellecalise/v4s33p6t/)</p>



<p> 26% of student victims who did not report to police believed the incident
was a personal matter, and 1 in 5 stated a fear of reprisal. </p>


Statistics from "Rape and violence against college aged females" – I’m using this document because it specifically focuses on college-aged women and that’s definitely the age group that I’m targeting with this project
