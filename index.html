  <h2> Answer: As women get older, the wage gap actually gets worse.</h2>
    <p> Even if ladies make the same amount as their male counterparts early in their careers, there's something called the <strong>motherhood penalty</strong> that can make things harder for them later in life. </p>

    <p>University of Massachusetts sociologist Michelle Budig found that on average, <a href= "http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay" target="_blank"> men make 6% more when they had children, and women made 4% less for EACH child that they had.</a>

      <h1>True or false – the United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t have paid maternity or family leave.</h1>
          <button type="button" class="btn pinkbtn otherbut" data-slide="#mleaveanswer">True</button>
          <button type="button" class="btn pinkbtn otherbut" data-slide="#mleaveanswer">False</button>


  </section>



  <section id="mleaveanswer" class="all-secs pink">
        <h2> Answer: True</h2>
            <p> The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/" target="_blank"> Family and Medical Leave Act</a> created up to 12 weeks of <strong> unpaid</strong> family leave for things like caring for a sick family member or the birth of a baby. But many families can't afford to take unpaid leave. </p>
            <p> There is no guaranteed paid family leave, unless your employer grants it or you live in California, Rhode Island or New Jersey, which offer state-mandated paid leave. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/" target="_blank"> only 13 percent of employers offer paid maternity leave</a>. </p>

            <p>This is a problem because caregiving typically falls on women. However, <a href="  http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/no-paid-maternity-leave/470889/" target="_blank">40 percent of women are breadwinners for their families, and 70 percent of mothers work outside the home.</a> </p>

  <section id="mwhy" class="all-secs pink">
    <h1> Ok, so why is the wage gap happening? </h1>
    <ul>
     <li>Some common reasons for the wage gap are occupational segregation, differences in the number of hours worked and educational attainment.</li>
     <li>Experts also attribute <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/" target="_blank"> 20-40% of the wage gap to other reasons </a> that are much harder to quantify, including gender stereotypes, male-dominated career networks and the fact that women are less likely to negotiate for raises and promotions. </li>
     <li> Finally, some of the gap can be explained by gender descrimination. Women are <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/" target="_blank"> twice as likely </a> to say that they felt descriminated in the workplace. </li>

    a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner. Unfortunately, it's a huge problem in America.</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> In the United States, a woman is beaten or assaulted <strong> every 9 seconds. </strong> </li>
      <li> <strong> One-third </strong> of female homicide victims are women killed by an intimate partner. </li>

  <h2> Support contraceptive access and family planning centers </h2>

  <p> Publicly-funded family planning services are crucial  in providing resources for women -- both the ladies that want families and those who don't.
  According to the Guttmacher Institute, these facilities <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/publicly-funded-family-planning-services-united-states" target="_blank"> helped women avoid two million unintended pregnancies.</a> The Institute estimates that those pregnancies would have resulted in 900,000 unplanned births and nearly 700,000 abortions.</p>

  <p>Title X is the US Government's program that funds confidential, low-cost family planning services </p>
  <p> According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, <a href="https://www.reproductiverights.org/project/contraceptive-access-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"> funding for the U.S. Government's Title X is decreasing.</a> It's 61% lower today than it was in 1980.</p>
  <p> To help, you can support family planning services. <p>
  <p> You can also reach out to your elected officials and let them know that defunding family planning centers is harmful to the women that depend on them.

<h1> You can also support comprehensive, fact-based sex education </h1>
<h2> How does this help? </h2>
  <p> More than 47 percent of high school students say they've had sex, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-policies-on-sex-education-in-schools.aspx" target="_blank">according to a 2011 study by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. </a> And only 60% of the students surveyed said they used a condom during their last sexual encounter!</p>

  <p> Here's the insane part -- <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education" target="_blank"> only 22 states mandate sex and HIV education, and only 13 require that sex ed is medically  accurate.</a> </p>

  <p> Studies show that <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education" target="_blank"> abstinence-only education is not effective,</a> according to the United Nations Population Fund. </p>

  <p> The solution: we need to make sexual and reproductive health more accessible to adolescents.<p>

  <h1>About this website</h1>
  <p> The American Woman was created to document some of the issues that frustrate many women in our country today. We enjoy so many more freedoms than women did in the past, not to mention women today that are oppressed in other parts of the world, but there are still so many areas for improvement. Not only does the site aim to educate people about the issues women still face today -- I hope it motivates you to take action! </p>
