   <h2>Answer: False </h2>
     <p> The bad news: According to the US Department of Commerce, the average woman made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned in 2014. </p>

     <p>The good news: the gap is smaller for young women, who earn 93% of the average hourly wage of men the same age, <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/">according to the Pew Research Center.</a></p>

  <h2> Answer: It actually gets worse.</h2>
    <p> Even if ladies make the same amount as their male counterparts early in their careers, there's something called the <strong>motherhood penalty</strong> that can make things harder for them later in life. </p>

    <p>University of Massachusetts sociologist Michelle Budig found that on average, <a href= "http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay"> men make 6% more when they had children, and women made 4% less for EACH child that they had.</a>

  <section id="sec5" class="all-secs">
      <h1>True or false – the United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t have paid maternity or family leave.</h1>
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">True</button>
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">False</button>
  </section>



  <section id="sec6" class="all-secs pink">
        <h2> Answer: True</h2>
            <p> There is no guaranteed family leave, unless your employer grants it or you live in California, Rhode Island or New Jersey, which offer state-mandated paid leave. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/"> only 13 percent of employers offer paid maternity leave</a>. </p>

            <p>This is a problem because caregiving typically falls on women. However, <a href="  http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/no-paid-maternity-leave/470889/">40 percent of women are breadwinners for their families, and 70 percent of mothers work outside the home.</a> </p>

  <section id="sec7" class="all-secs">
    <h1> Ok, so why is the wage gap happening? </h1>
    <ul>
     <li>Some common reasons for the wage gap are occupational segregation, differences in the number of hours worked and educational attainment.</li>
     <li>Experts also attribute <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/"> 20-40% of the wage gap to other reasons </a> that are much harder to quantify, including gender stereotypes, male-dominated career networks and the fact that women are less likely to negotiate for raises and promotions. </li>
     <li> Finally, some of the gap can be explained by gender descrimination. Women are <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/"> twice as likely </a> to say that they felt descriminated in the workplace. </li>
    </ul>
